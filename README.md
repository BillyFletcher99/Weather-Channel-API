This one took a little bit, and a lot of youtube videos to get it where it currently is now. At first, it was pretty funny because i had gotten everything working,
but for some reason it would only give me Detroits information, is it was looking like an app for people living there only lol. But after tinkering awhile i got it so
it would actually display and read the prompt from whatever was typed into the search bar.

Here is an example of it now showing New York as well. It's going to take a little more time to get the 5-day forcast, as i am having troubles with that, but for my first time implementing an API I'm somewhat happy with the result.


THIS ASSIGNMENT HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETED, I am missing the 5 day forecast. I unfortunately got wrapped up in the group project.
